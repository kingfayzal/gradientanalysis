# Gradient Boosting Analysis
# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Gradient Boosting for classification and regression tasks. Two datasets are used: the Iris dataset for classification and the California Housing dataset for regression.

## Classification: Iris Dataset

## Goal
Predict the class of iris flowers based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
